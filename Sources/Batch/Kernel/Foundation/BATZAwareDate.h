/**
 BATZAwareDate is a helper date class used to understand timezone aware dates.

 Dates can be communicated using timestamps, making them much cheaper to parse than string based date formats,
 but allows the offsetting of the underlying UTC timestamp to match a local time.

 If you give this date a NSDate representing "2017-02-03 08:00 UTC", and set "relativeToUserTZ" to YES,
 it will offset the UTC date so that it becomes "2017-02-03 08:00" in the local timezone.

 For example, if the current timezone is "UTC+2", "2017-02-03 08:00 UTC" would be offsetted to become
 "2017-02-03 06:00".
